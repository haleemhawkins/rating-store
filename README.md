The proposed software product is an advanced Sentiment Analysis for Product Rating system. Its core functionality lies in detecting sentiments in user comments and assigning ratings to products based on these sentiments. 
The system operates within an E-Commerce web application where users can view products and their features, leave comments about the products, and view other users' comments. 
The system's backend utilizes a database of sentiment-based keywords, each assigned a positivity or negativity weight. 
User comments are analyzed by comparing them with these keywords to determine the product's rating. 
This application also enables admin roles, where an admin can add new products and keywords to the system.
